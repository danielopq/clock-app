## Overview

This app connects with multiple RESTful APIs, including worldtimeapi.org, api.ipgeolocation.io, and zenquotes.io, to retrieve and display various types of information. One of its features allows users to obtain a random quote from a famous person by simply clicking a button. Additionally, the app provides detailed location-based data such as the user's location, time zone, local time, day of the week, and more.

A notable functionality is the ability to fetch local sunrise and sunset times, which the app uses to determine whether it is currently day or night at the user's location. Based on this information, it dynamically adjusts the icons and background theme to visually represent the time of day, enhancing the user experience.

The application is fully responsive, ensuring seamless usability across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This adaptability is achieved through responsive design principles.

For the development, I used React and TypeScript, leveraging their powerful features to build a robust, scalable, and type-safe application.

## My process

I initially developed the website entirely for the desktop version, ensuring all elements were properly structured and aligned with the design specifications. After confirming that the desktop layout met all functional and aesthetic requirements, I proceeded to adapt the design for tablet and mobile devices.

The mobile and tablet versions were implemented using CSS media queries, allowing for seamless responsiveness across various screen sizes without the need for a complete redesign. By adjusting layouts, typography, and element positioning through media queries, I ensured a consistent user experience across devices while maintaining the integrity of the original design.

Key aspects of the process included:

  - Desktop-first approach for optimizing performance and usability on larger screens before scaling down to smaller devices.
  - Responsive layouts that dynamically adjust content and visuals, ensuring a clean and intuitive user interface on both tablets and smartphones.
  - Testing and optimization across multiple devices and browsers to ensure cross-platform compatibility and a smooth user experience on all devices.
