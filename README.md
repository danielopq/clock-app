## Overview

This project is a three-section coffee website with a clean and simple, yet attractive design. The site provides information about the company and its various coffee varieties, while also allowing customers to customize a regular delivery plan according to their tastes and needs. The entire website has been developed using React and TypeScript, ensuring a modern, maintainable, and efficient codebase.
Key Features:

  - Customizable Delivery Plans: One of the standout features of the website is the "Create Your Plan" section. This section allows users to design a personalized coffee subscription by selecting different options for coffee types, grind preferences, quantity, and delivery frequency. The interface includes an intuitive step-by-step process with multiple choice options, an interactive index, and an order summary that visually guides users through the customization process, making it easy and engaging.

  - Responsive Design: The website has been fully optimized for different devices, with distinct layouts for desktop, laptop, and mobile versions. This ensures a seamless user experience across all screen sizes.

  - Modern Tech Stack: Built with React for the front-end and TypeScript for type safety and code quality, the website demonstrates best practices in modern web development, including component-based architecture and state management.

The result is a user-friendly and visually appealing site that makes exploring coffee options and setting up personalized delivery plans simple and enjoyable.

## My process

I initially developed the website entirely for the desktop version, ensuring all elements were properly structured and aligned with the design specifications. After confirming that the desktop layout met all functional and aesthetic requirements, I proceeded to adapt the design for tablet and mobile devices.

The mobile and tablet versions were implemented using CSS media queries, allowing for seamless responsiveness across various screen sizes without the need for a complete redesign. By adjusting layouts, typography, and element positioning through media queries, I ensured a consistent user experience across devices while maintaining the integrity of the original design.

Key aspects of the process included:

  - Desktop-first approach for optimizing performance and usability on larger screens before scaling down to smaller devices.
  - Responsive layouts that dynamically adjust content and visuals, ensuring a clean and intuitive user interface on both tablets and smartphones.
  - Testing and optimization across multiple devices and browsers to ensure cross-platform compatibility and a smooth user experience on all devices.
